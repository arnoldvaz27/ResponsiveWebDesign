<h3>C#</h3>
                        <p>
C# is a modern, general-purpose, object-oriented programming language developed by Microsoft and approved by Ecma and ISO.

C# was developed by Anders Hejlsberg and his team during the development of .Net Framework.

C# is designed for Common Language Infrastructure (CLI), which consists of the executable code and runtime environment that allows use of various high-level languages to be used on different computer platforms and architectures.<a href="#" class="readmorebtn">Read More &raquo;</a>

                <h3> JAVA </h3>

                        <p>Java is a computer programming language that is concurrent, class-based, object-oriented, and specifically designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is intended to let application developers "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that code that runs on one platform does not need to be recompiled to run on another. Java applications are typically compiled to bytecode that can run on any Java virtual machine (JVM) regardless of computer architecture. Java is, as of 2014, one of the most popular programming languages in use, particularly for client-server web applications, with a reported 9 million developers.<a href="#" class="readmorebtn">Read More &raquo;</a>                   </p>

                <h3>PHP</h3>
                        <p>
PHP is one of the server side scripting languages that enables creating dynamic and interactive Web applications. PHP has a number of features such as high performance, low cost security, and portability that helps you to develop robust Web applications. Moreover, it can be used to develop a wide range of applications in different business domains, such as e-commerce and project management.<a href="#" class="readmorebtn">Read More &raquo;</a>

<h3>PYTHON</h3>
                        <p>
Python is a widely used general-purpose, high-level programming language. Its design philosophy emphasizes code readability, and its syntax allows programmers to express concepts in fewer lines of code than would be possible in languages such as C.The language provides constructs intended to enable clear programs on both a small and large scale.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms, including object-oriented, imperative and functional programming or procedural styles. It features a dynamic type system and automatic memory management and has a large and comprehensive standard library.<a href="#" class="readmorebtn">Read More &raquo;</a> </p>
